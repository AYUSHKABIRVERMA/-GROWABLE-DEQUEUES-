# -GROWABLE-DEQUEUES-
I implementation of  circular growable dequeue

Task is to implement a generic ArrayDequeue class.
Implementation must be done in terms of an array that grows by doubling as needed. Your initial array must
have a length of one slot only.

Implementation must support all Dequeue operations except insertion in (worst-case) constant time; insertion
can take longer every now and then (when you need to grow the array), but overall all insertion operations must be
constant amortized time.
